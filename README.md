# Sexism Detection in English and Spanish Tweets

Sexism is defined as discrimination of a person or group based on sex. In many cases, these gender stereotypes assume a difference in social standing between men and women. However, this discrimination can be expressed explicitly (discrimination that is stated plainly) or implicitly (discrimination that is implied or obfuscated). The examples below from the EXIST 2023 dataset show the distinction between explicit and implicit sexism:

Explicit: Call me sexist all you want but no Nation ever succeeds with a woman as the Head. Itâ€™s just the way it is. They final nail is already in the coffin.

Implicit: Wife material, wake up and cook for your husband
